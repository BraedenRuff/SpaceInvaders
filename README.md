# SpaceInvaders

This project is just a small little game of space invaders I made cause I thought it would be fun. You play as a NOBLE ship fighting against the EVIL aliens! Go back and forth and kill the aliens that come down one line at a time when they reach the end of the screen, just like normal space invaders, but you can upgrade the ship based on how many aliens you shot down, and there is 3 bosses! One at level 10, one at level 20, one at level 30.

CONTROLS: arrow keys to move, space bar to shoot, shift to slow down, control to speed up, p to pause the game, and enter (or mouse click) to start defending your base!

-Can upgrade how many shots you have on screen at the same time
-Can upgrade how many aliens the shots go through
-There are 3 "big" gun upgrades:
  -Shotgun modifier:
    -Instead of shooting one bullet at a time, shoot all your bullets at once after a short charging time in a small spread in front of your ship, also removes cap on how many of your bullets can be on the screen
  -Boomerang modifier:
    -Instead of flying past the EVIL aliens, your shots come back after reaching the top of the screen and attacks the alliens from behind
  -Homing modifier:
    -Your bullets will now fly towards the space aliens to more easily bring them to their doom!
-Bonus ships that fly across the screen and give you more points
-Retro music
-Scoreboard (only works per instance cause I didn't end up getting around to storing the data in a file anywhere) - have to beat final boss to show it though ;)
-Shields the player can hide behind that stops all bullets
-Included a give credit button so you can just upgrade your ship if you don't want to grind, but you ARE cheating just so you know :p
